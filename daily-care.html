            <h2>Grooming the Iconic Double Coat</h2>
            
            <h3>Brushing: More Than Just for Looks</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Prevents matting, reduces shedding, allows you to check their skin for lumps or parasites, and strengthens your bond.</p>
            <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> At least 2-3 times a week, and daily during shedding seasons (spring and fall).</p>
            
            <h4>Essential Tools:</h4>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-icon"><i class="bi bi-brush-fill"></i></div>
                    <h4>Pin Brush</h4>
                    <p>For brushing the outer topcoat.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-icon"><i class="bi bi-grip-horizontal"></i></div>
                    <h4>Undercoat Rake</h4>
                    <p><strong>(Highly Recommended!)</strong> Effectively removes loose undercoat, key to preventing matting and overheating.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-icon"><i class="bi bi-list-task"></i></div>
                    <h4>Steel Comb</h4>
                    <p>For checking your work and combing detailed areas like behind the ears and leg furnishings.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="safety-box warning">
                <h4>A Big "NO": Never Shave Your Aussie!</h4>
                <p>Their double coat acts as insulation, keeping them warm in winter and cool in summer by blocking heat and UV rays. Shaving destroys this system, leading to potential sunburn and follicle damage.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Bathing, Nails & Ears</h3>
            <p><strong>Bathing:</strong> Infrequently needed. Usually every 2-3 months or when they get particularly dirty. Over-bathing strips natural oils. Always use a dog-specific shampoo.</p>
            <p><strong>Nail Trimming:</strong> 1-2 times a month. If you hear "click-clack" on the floor, they're too long. Learn to use clippers or a grinder, being careful to avoid the quick (the blood vessel).</p>
            <p><strong>Ear Cleaning:</strong> Check weekly. An Aussie's floppy ears can trap dirt and moisture. Use a dedicated ear cleaner and cotton balls (not swabs!) to clean the outer ear canal. See a vet if you notice a bad smell, redness, or discharge.</p>

            <h2>Nutrition & Diet</h2>
            <h3>Feeding Guidelines</h3>
            <p><strong>Choosing a Food:</strong> Opt for high-quality dog food designed for active breeds. The first ingredient should be a specific meat (like chicken, beef, or fish), not a grain or by-product.</p>
            <p><strong>Portion Control:</strong> Follow the package recommendations and adjust based on your dog's activity level, age, and weight. You should be able to feel their ribs, but not see them.</p>
            <p><strong>Raw/Homemade Diets:</strong> If considering a BARF or homemade diet, you must consult a veterinarian or canine nutritionist to ensure a balanced diet, especially the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio.</p>

            <h2>Health Core: Prevention & Check-ups</h2>
            
            <h3>Routine Prevention Plan</h3>
            <p>Work with your vet to create a tailored plan. This generally includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Core vaccines (Distemper, Parvovirus, Hepatitis, Rabies) and non-core vaccines based on your location and lifestyle (e.g., Leptospirosis, Bordetella).</li>
                <li><strong>Parasite Control:</strong> Monthly prevention for heartworm, intestinal worms, fleas, and ticks is crucial.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Genetic Issues in Aussies to be Aware Of</h3>
            <div class="accordion">
                <button class="accordion-header">Hip/Elbow Dysplasia</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>A common skeletal condition that can lead to arthritis and pain. Prevention includes buying from reputable breeders (parents should have OFA/PennHIP certification), maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding excessive high-impact exercise during puppyhood.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion-header">Eye Problems</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Aussies are prone to several eye conditions like cataracts, Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA), and Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA). Responsible breeders will have their breeding stock tested. Regular vet eye exams are recommended.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion-header">MDR1 Gene Mutation</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p><strong>(VERY IMPORTANT!)</strong> This is a drug sensitivity gene. Aussies with this mutation can have severe or even fatal neurological reactions to common drugs like Ivermectin and some anti-vomiting/sedative medications. <strong>Action:</strong> It is strongly recommended to have your Aussie tested for the MDR1 gene. Until you have the results, inform every vet that your dog is an Aussie and may be sensitive to certain drugs.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion-header">Epilepsy</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Aussies are one of the breeds with a higher incidence of epilepsy. If your dog has a seizure, stay calm, clear the area of hazards, time the seizure, and contact your vet as soon as possible.</p>
