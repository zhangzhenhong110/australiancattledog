            <h2>Your Aussie: A High-Energy Companion</h2>
            <p>Is your Aussie a perpetual motion machine, always looking for something to do, eagerly awaiting the next adventure? Congratulations, you have a typical high-intelligence, high-energy working dog! But "high energy" is a double-edged sword. Proper guidance can make it your best sports partner, while unmanaged energy can turn into destruction, barking, and anxiety.</p>
            <p class="golden-rule">Remember our golden rule: <strong>A tired Aussie is a happy and well-behaved Aussie.</strong> This guide will teach you how to scientifically and effectively manage your "little motor's" energy, allowing you and your beloved dog to enjoy a fulfilling and happy life together.</p>

            <h2>Why a Simple Walk Isn't Enough</h2>
            <p>For an Australian Shepherd, a leisurely daily stroll around the block is like asking a marathon runner to do a few light stretches. Their bodies and brains are naturally designed for endurance, speed, and problem-solving. We need to provide higher quality "energy discharge" activities.</p>

            <h2>High-Intensity Physical Exercise: The Best Way to Burn Calories</h2>
            
            <h3>Daily Essentials</h3>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-icon"><i class="bi bi-disc-fill"></i></div>
                    <h4>Frisbee & Fetch</h4>
                    <p>This isn't just a "you throw, I get" game. Frisbee is one of an Aussie's favorites, perfectly combining running, jumping, and their tracking instincts. <strong>Tip:</strong> Choose soft, dog-specific frisbees to protect your dog's teeth and mouth. Start training with short-distance, low-rolling throws.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-icon"><i class="bi bi-signpost-split-fill"></i></div>
                    <h4>Jogging & Hiking</h4>
                    <p>If you love the outdoors, an Aussie is your perfect running or hiking companion. They have amazing stamina. <strong>Safety First:</strong> Ensure your dog is over 12-18 months old and their bones are fully developed before engaging in long-distance or high-intensity running. In hot weather, please choose early morning or evening.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-icon"><i class="bi bi-water"></i></div>
                    <h4>Swimming</h4>
                    <p>An extremely joint-friendly, full-body workout! Most Aussies are natural swimmers. Swimming not only burns energy quickly but also cools them down in the hot summer. Remember to use a dog life jacket and start in shallow water to get them accustomed.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Options: Structured Dog Sports</h3>

                    <div class="card-icon"><i class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow"></i></div>
                    <h4>Agility</h4>
                    <p>This is an Aussie's "home turf"! Agility perfectly combines speed, skill, obedience, and human-dog communication. It's both a physical workout and a top-tier mental stimulation. You can look for local agility clubs or online courses to get started.</p>

                    <h4>Herding Instinct Training</h4>
                    <p>Let your Aussie do what it was born to do! Even if you don't live on a farm, you can participate in herding experiences or training camps. This greatly satisfies their primal instincts and brings unparalleled fulfillment.</p>

                    <h4>Canine Frisbee / Dock Diving</h4>
                    <p>If your Aussie shows extraordinary talent in a sport, why not try amateur competitions? It's not only the ultimate way to burn off energy but also a fantastic opportunity to deepen your bond.</p>

            <h2>Safety First, Always</h2>
            <div class="safety-box">
                <p><strong>Puppy Warning:</strong> Puppies under 8 months have fragile bones. Avoid high-impact jumps and intense running on hard surfaces. Focus on short, frequent play sessions.</p>
                <p><strong>Weather Awareness:</strong> Aussies with their double coat are prone to heatstroke. Avoid exercising during the hottest part of the day in summer and ensure fresh water is always available.</p>
                <p><strong>Listen to Your Dog:</strong> Learn to recognize signs of fatigue (e.g., lagging behind, excessive panting, slow movements). Over-exercise is as harmful as under-exercise.</p>
                <p><strong>Warm-up & Cool-down:</strong> Just like humans, a simple warm-up before exercise and a cool-down walk afterward help prevent muscle strains.</p>
